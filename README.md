# Pattern-Recognition

Pattern recognition course project.  

#### Text of the task 1  
In the MSTeams platform team, there is a database of images of hands showing 'paper', 'rock', and 'scissors'. Design an innovative system for recognizing the shown signs based on hypothesis testing. a) Describe in detail the algorithm for image processing and feature selection that precedes the classification itself. The algorithm should be as robust as possible (to handle different lighting conditions, hand positions, and ways of showing the signs, etc.). b) Perform a split into training and test sets. Display the classification results of the test set in the form of a confusion matrix. c) Choose two signs and two features such that the selected signs are as separable as possible in that feature space. Display the feature histogram for both signs and comment on their shape. d) For the signs and features in part c), design a parametric classifier of your choice and plot the classification boundary.  

#### Text of the task 2  
Generate N = 500 samples from two two-dimensional bimodal classes: Ω1 ∼ P11N(M11, Σ11) + P12N(M12, Σ12) Ω2 ∼ P21N(M21, Σ21) + P22N(M22, Σ22) Choose the class parameters independently. a) Plot the samples on a diagram. b) Draw the theoretical probability density functions for the class distributions and compare them with the histogram of the generated samples. c) Design the Bayesian classifier with minimal error and sketch the classification boundary on the diagram, along with the samples. Compare the classification error of the specific samples with the theoretical classification errors of the first and second kinds for the given setup. d) Design a classifier with minimal cost such that misclassifying samples from the first class is penalized more. e) Repeat the previous step for the Neyman-Pearson classifier. Justify the choice ϵ1 = ϵ0. f) For the classes generated in the previous steps, design the Wald sequential test.

#### Text of the class 3  
1. Generate three classes of two-dimensional shapes. Choose the probability density function of the shapes so that the classes are linearly separable. a) For the generated shapes, design a linear classifier using one of the three iterative procedures. Present the results in the form of a confusion matrix. Describe the classification process in detail. b) Repeat the previous step using the desired output method. Analyze the impact of the elements in the desired output matrix on the final form of the linear classifier. 2. Generate two classes of two-dimensional shapes that are separable, but not linearly, and then design a quadratic classifier using the desired method.

#### Text of the task 4  
1. Generate N = 500 two-dimensional samples from four classes that will be linearly separable. It is recommended that these be Gaussian-distributed two-dimensional shapes. Choose one of the clustering methods (c-means method, quadratic decomposition method) and apply it to the generated class samples. Perform sensitivity analysis of the chosen algorithm to the initial clustering as well as the average number of iterations required. Also, perform an analysis in the case where the number of classes is not known in advance. 2. From the samples in the previous step, choose one of the clustering methods (maximum likelihood method or branch-and-bound method) and apply it to the generated class samples. Perform sensitivity analysis of the chosen algorithm to the initial clustering as well as the average number of iterations required. Also, perform an analysis in the case where the number of classes is not known in advance. 3. Generate N = 500 two-dimensional samples from two classes that are non-linearly separable. Choose one of the clustering methods applicable to non-linearly separable classes (quadratic decomposition method or maximum likelihood method) and repeat the analysis from the previous steps.
